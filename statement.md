PROBLEM STATEMENT  
The project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to load, analyse, and visualise student mraks data from a CSV file. It addresses the need for educators and analysts to quickly assess student performance through key statistical metrics and graphical representations.  
  
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT  
This project covers loading student marks data, calculating fundamental statistical measures (mean, median, highest, lowest, standard deviation), and generating a visual bar chart to represent students’ marks. It focuses on offline data analysis for single-subject marks without advanced features like predictive analytics or database integrationss.  
  
TARGET USERS  
Educator and teacher who want to analyze class performance easily.  
Academic analysts and researchers interested in quick data summarization.  
Students and learners exploring data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.  
  
ADVANCE FEATURES  
Loading student names and marks from a CSV file.  
Calculating key descriptive statistics such as meean, median, max, min, and standard deviation.  
Errors handling for missing or incorrect files.   
Displaying a bar charts to visualize marks distribution among students.
